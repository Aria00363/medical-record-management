# Medical Records Management Smart Contract

## Introduction
The Medical Records Management Smart Contract is a decentralized solution built on the Aptos blockchain that enables secure, patient-controlled medical record management. This smart contract empowers patients to maintain ownership of their medical records while providing controlled access to authorized healthcare providers.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize how medical records are managed and shared in the healthcare industry by:
- Putting patients in complete control of their medical data
- Ensuring data privacy and security through blockchain technology
- Streamlining the process of sharing medical information between healthcare providers
- Reducing administrative overhead in healthcare record management
- Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive medical information
- Creating a transparent and immutable audit trail of medical record access

## Core Features
1. **Patient-Controlled Records**
   - Patients can create and manage their own medical records
   - Full control over who can access their medical information

2. **Doctor Access Management**
   - Patients can grant and revoke access to specific doctors
   - Granular control over medical record visibility

3. **Security First Approach**
   - Built-in access control mechanisms
   - Blockchain-based immutability
   - Error handling for unauthorized access attempts

## Future Goals
1. **Short-term Goals (Q2-Q3 2024)**
   - Implement record update functionality
   - Add record deletion/deactivation features
   - Create events for tracking access history
   - Develop emergency access protocols

2. **Medium-term Goals (Q4 2024)**
   - Integration with healthcare provider systems
   - Implementation of role-based access control
   - Support for different types of medical records
   - Advanced encryption features

3. **Long-term Goals (2025 and beyond)**
   - Cross-chain medical record sharing
   - AI-powered access pattern analysis
   - Integration with telemedicine platforms
   - Support for research data sharing with anonymization

## Technical Details

### Contract Structure
```move
struct MedicalRecord {
    patient_address: address,
    record_data: String,
    authorized_doctors: vector<address>,
    is_active: bool
}
```

### Key Functions
1. `create_medical_record`: Creates a new medical record for a patient
2. `manage_doctor_access`: Manages doctor access permissions

## Deployment Information
- **Network**: Aptos Mainnet
- **Contract Address**: 0xe73348e9957cd832f6475cee857d029c406fd503486f7805dee41a8226c6fff7
- **Chain**: Aptos
- **Deployment Date**: November 17, 2024

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Aptos CLI
- Move Compiler
- Aptos Wallet

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Deploy using Aptos CLI

### Usage Example

manage_doctor_access(patient, doctor_address, true);
```

## Security Considerations
- Only patients can create and manage their records
- Access control is enforced at the contract level
- All transactions are recorded on the blockchain
- Regular security audits are recommended
